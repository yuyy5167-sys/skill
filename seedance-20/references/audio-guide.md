# Audio Guide

Use this reference for detailed audio, dialogue, beat-sync, ambience, and lip-sync workflows. Keep audio roles explicit and avoid promising exact platform behavior unless the active surface documents it.

For professional audio post, stems, M&E, dubbing, loudness, or delivery checks, also load `audio-post-delivery.md`.

## Dialogue

- Keep lines short, preferably one sentence per speaker turn.
- Put spoken dialogue in quotes.
- Assign the speaker by tag.
- Use stable framing for lip-sync.
- Avoid head turns, large face movement, extreme camera moves, or busy hand action while mouth accuracy matters.
- If the line matters more than the environment, reduce music and SFX during the line.
- Non-English dialogue: keep lines even shorter - long non-English phrases are a field-reported weak spot. For a fully voiced non-English piece, plan a post-dub instead, and check the language's vocab file for dialogue notes.

## Audio reference mapping

`[Audio1]` can be used for rhythm, pacing, mood, voice tone, ambience, music texture, or beat timing. Do not promise exact audio playback unless the active platform documents exact playback behavior. If the source contains a real voice or recognizable song, treat it as authorization-sensitive and convert it into broad sonic descriptors when rights are unclear.

When an audio reference and video reference compete, silence or mute the video reference before upload when the audio should control timing. If the video must keep sound, state the priority: `[Video1] controls only camera/motion; [Audio1] controls tempo and energy`.

| Role | Good wording | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Tempo | `[Audio1] provides tempo only; foot taps match the downbeat` | copying a protected performance |
| Mood | `[Audio1] provides calm sparse atmosphere` | exact replay claim |
| Voice tone | `soft, breathy, close-mic delivery` | imitating a named real voice |
| Ambience | `rainy street room tone, distant traffic bed` | dense competing sound layers |
| Conflict repair | `[Video1] is muted and controls camera only; [Audio1] controls beat timing` | two sources both controlling rhythm |

## Multi-character dialogue

Use separate speaker turns when reliability matters. For two-person exchanges, generate controlled single-speaker clips and composite in post when necessary. If two speakers remain in one prompt, write: `Character A says... pause. Character B answers...` and keep the camera locked or gently motivated.

## Sound layer syntax

`Dialogue: Character A says "I found it." Sound: low room tone + distant rain. SFX: cup lands on table at 2s. Music: no music until after the line.`

## Beat-sync syntax

`[Audio1] provides tempo only. On each downbeat: back wall light pulses once, dancer hits one pose, camera remains locked wide.` Use visible beat changes rather than asking the model to understand an abstract groove.

## Audio as clock

Field-observed technique; test before promising results. Beyond mood and tempo, `[Audio1]` can act as the master clock of the edit: `cut on the beat of [Audio1]; the turn lands on the drop; the door slams on the final hit.`

- Tie each musical landmark to exactly one visible event - a cut, a pose, a light change, an object landing. One event per beat; stacked events smear.
- Works best with a single strong rhythm (clean drums, a metronomic pulse). Dense mixes or rubato material give the model no clock to follow.
- When the audio is the clock, make it the only clock: mute video references and avoid second timing systems such as timestamp lists in the same prompt.
- The clock works inside one generation only; audio is not continuous across calls, so multi-clip pieces get their unifying score in post.

## Troubleshooting

- Desync: shorten dialogue, stabilize camera, remove head motion, reduce competing sound, and clean source audio role.
- Wrong speaker: split lines by speaker and use explicit character tags.
- Audio ignored: remove competing music/SFX instructions and make `[Audio1]` role explicit.
- Overbusy mix: choose ambience plus one key SFX; remove music if dialogue matters.
- Lip-sync drift: use a locked medium close-up, no head turn, short quoted line, and simple expression.
- Audio-reference conflict: mute the video reference, remove competing SFX/music, and describe one visible event per beat.

## Post Handoff Boundary

Prompt audio can shape performance and visible timing, but final mixes need post-production review. For paid or delivery work, record spoken language, subtitle/dubbing needs, M&E/stem needs, sync cues, and buyer loudness target separately from the prompt.
